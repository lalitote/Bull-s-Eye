## Bull's Eye game (iOS Apprentice tutorial)

### Overview

Bull's Eye - a basic iOS application developed in Swift - is a simple game. The tutorial is part of the iOS Apprentice Series 
from RayWenderlich.com. The objective of the game is to put the bull’s eye, which is on a slider that goes from 1 to 100, 
as close to a randomly chosen target value as possible. The closer to the target value player is, the more points he scores. 
The game repeats until the player presses the “Start Over” button, which resets the score to 0.

### Changes
I've made one change in showAlert() function: I replaced if statment with switch.
